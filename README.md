# web calculator

A companion to <https://ue22-p23-web.readthedocs.io/>

## Instructions

The assignment is to write a calculator in JavaScript.

The starter code contains

- HTML and CSS - the graphical design has been done for you, so you probably
  won't need to change them
- an empty `script.js` file where you will write your code

You can load this code in your browser to see the look,
but it won't do anything until you write the JavaScript.

## Instructions

1. clone the repo locally on your computer
2. push it back on github into a personal repo forked from this one
3. either make it public or invite your teacher as a collaborator
4. open `index.html` in a browser to check you have a nice non-funcionnal calculator
5. open `script.js` in vs-code
6. add your initials or your name in a comment at the top of the js
7. modify `script.js` in order to implement a functional calculator  *‚Üê that's the exercise*
8. baby steps please, don't hesitate to commit every time a small feature is working
9. push your repo whenever you think it's worth being reviewed by your teacher; you may even push your repo at every commit
